# Implementation-of-code-compression-and-decompression

## Description
Implement code compression and decompression using encoding techniques, such as RLE(run length encoding), bitmask and dictionary.


## Files included
1. original.txt -> The file has uncompressed input instructions.
2. Compressed.txt -> The file has compressed input instructions.
3. cout.txt -> The file has a compressed output instructions after compressed.
4. dout.txt -> The file has a decompressed output instructions after decompressed.
5. reference.txt -> The file has both compressed and decompressed instructions for reference purpose.

## Environment
OS            - Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (64-bit)
Java Compiler - javac 1.8.0_162 (64-bit)
